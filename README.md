Understanding the Basics of the python Flask AP

`You will be able to learn and understand how to design and implement RESTful APIâ€™s via the Flask framework.`

### This is a Basic Python Flask Framework used to implement a REST API

## Introduction
### RESTful API

A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service -- is based on representational state transfer (REST) technology, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.

REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST leverages less bandwidth, making it more suitable for internet usage.  The API spells out the proper way for a developer to write a program requesting services from an operating system or other application.
